# Eam Talon Scripts

Custom Talon Voice scripts.

These scripts are based on the Talon community scripts, but are almost entirely rewritten and
pared-down. They only support MacOS and are heavily customized.

These scripts are not currently compatible with
[Cursorless](https://github.com/cursorless-dev/cursorless/tree/main), but have a feature called
Scrambler that makes Cursorless-like commmands available globally. In it, words/tokens are typically
identified using their first few letters. e.g. to select "identified", you could say `pick sit drum`
or just `grab identified`. If the word or character sequence occurs in multiple places, you can
disambiguate: `pick second last sit drum`, `grab next identified`.
